title: Tutorials Updated for Blacklight 7!
---

In anticipation of the [2018 Princeton Blacklight Summit](http://library.princeton.edu/blacklight-summit) we have been updating the tutorials here to be accurate for all the changes in the Blacklight 7 release (as well as adding additional useful content).

The navigation on the left has been updated to allow you to navigate the different versions available, and when within a particular version of tutorials navigate the various tutorials themselves.  Use the navigation on the left to browse the available versions or start with your [First Change in Blacklight 7]({{site.baseurl}}/v7.0.0/first_change/).
